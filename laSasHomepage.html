<div id="fightmelee"> <h1>WAGE GAP FACTS!</h1>
<h3>
Men used to have access to higher levels of education and experience compared to women before the 1970s. But, since the 1990s more women have received undergraduate and graduate degrees, and women are now more likely to work throughout their lifetimes.

According to a study of Census Bureau data, the average woman makes $430,480 less than her male counterpart over the course of 40 years of work. For African American women, that gap grows to $877,480, while for Latinas, it adds up to over $1 million.

The wage gap actually widened in 2015. Women made 81.1% of menâ€™s median weekly full-time earnings, a decrease of 1.4%  since 2014.
