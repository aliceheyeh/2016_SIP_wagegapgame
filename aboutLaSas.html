	<h1>The LA SAS Team</h1>
	<h5>LA SAS stands for Lee, Alice, Sabrina, Aissatou, and Susie. However, we also believe it stands for the "sass" and confidence that women should have in defending themselves and asking people to earn what they deserve. The group was started in the 2016 Girls Who Code Summer Immersion program at Accenture New York. We all agreed a topic we strongly cared about was the wage gap between men and women, so we decided we wanted to do something to spread awareness.  We hope you enjoy our website and game!</h5>
